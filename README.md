# LightOrange 

LightOrange is a simple octopress theme that extends the Classic theme. Currrently it is still a work in progress. You can view a demo [here](http://ericren.me).

Note: file structure is a bit messy.  Things to do:
- Need to move custom scss to base scss files.  
- Either take out or finish styling Portfolio plugin by Sebastian Ruiz.
